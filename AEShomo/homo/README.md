# AEShomo
homomorphic of evaluation of SM4 and AES based on circuit bootstrapping mode.

This is the source code for encryption using the latest AES algorithm.
AES algorithm is also called Rijndael algorithm. AES algorithm is
recommended for non-classified use by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology(NIST), USA. Now-a-days AES is being used for almost
all encryption applications all around the world.

THE MAIN FEATURE OF THIS AES ENCRYPTION PROGRAM IS NOT EFFICIENCY; IT
IS SIMPLICITY AND READABILITY. THIS SOURCE CODE IS PROVIDED FOR ALL
TO UNDERSTAND THE AES ALGORITHM.

Comments are provided as needed to understand the program. But the
user must read some AES documentation to understand the underlying
theory correctly.
It is not possible to describe the complete AES algorithm in detail
here. For the complete description of the algorithm, point your
